Compiler Final Project - Fall 2015
Programmers: Richard Erdtsieck and Justin Stewart
Program: This compiler takes in a text file with a pseudo code created by our professor. It cleans extra white space and comments 
out and then verifies the resulting code using given grammar. After it is verified it is translated into C++ code.
