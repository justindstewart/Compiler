Compiler Final Project - Fall 2015 <br />
Programmers: Richard Erdtsieck and Justin Stewart <br />
Program: This compiler takes in a text file with a pseudo code created by our professor. It cleans extra white space and comments 
out and then verifies the resulting code using given grammar. After it is verified it is translated into C++ code.<br />
